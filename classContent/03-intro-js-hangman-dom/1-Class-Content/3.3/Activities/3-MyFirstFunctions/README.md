**Instructions:**

	* Working in pairs and using the starter file sent to you via slack – fill in the missing functions and function calls.

	* Note: Try to finish all four functions if you can but don’t beat yourself up if you only get 1 or 2. The important thing is that you get at least one function fully done.

	* Hint: Look back the example just slacked to you.
