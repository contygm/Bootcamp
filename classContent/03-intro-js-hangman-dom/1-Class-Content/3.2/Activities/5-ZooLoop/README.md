**Instructions:**

	* Spend a few moments, re-writing the code below using a for-loop.

	```
	zooAnimals = ["Zebra", "Rhino", "Giraffe", "Owl"];

	console.log(zooAnimals[0]); 
	console.log(zooAnimals[1]);
	console.log(zooAnimals[2]);
	console.log(zooAnimals[3]);
	```

	* Feel free to use the code from the previous example as guide.

	* Once you think your code is functioning properly, try to explain to the person next to you how it works.
