 **Instructions:**

	* Download the code sent to you via slack. 
	 
	* Open it in Chrome and watch what happens.
	
	* Then open the file in Sublime and try to explain to someone around you how the code connects to the events seen on the page.
	
	* PS: I know we haven’t covered Javascript before…
	
	* MAJOR PS: When downloading any code going forward, be sure to hit “Download”. **If you copy and paste directly from Slack, your code will not work.**
