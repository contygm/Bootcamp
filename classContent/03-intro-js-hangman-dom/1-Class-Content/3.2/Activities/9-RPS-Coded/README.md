**Instructions:**

	* In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game. 

	* Do as much as you can on your own but raise your hand regularly to ask a TA or Instructor to help if you feel your team is struggling.

	* Note: Don’t worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won’t know where to start. In fact, we haven’t shown you EVERYTHING you need yet. But that’s okay. Accepting the confusion is a HUGE first step in becoming a coder since coding is all one big puzzle you solve with time and effort.
