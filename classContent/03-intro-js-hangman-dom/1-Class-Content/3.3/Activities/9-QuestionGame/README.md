**Instructions:**

* Starting from a blank HTML file:

	* Create an object with 10 questions. The object should be structured like this: q1: [“QUESTION”, “ANSWER”]	q2: [“QUESTION”, “ANSWER”]

	* Then create code that goes through the questions one by one and asks users each question. Users must hit t (for true) or f (for false).

	* Check the user’s answer against the correct answer and provide the user with an alert of some sort telling them if they are right or wrong. 

	* Bonus: Keep track of the number of questions the user gets right or wrong.

	* Hint: Don’t worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working
