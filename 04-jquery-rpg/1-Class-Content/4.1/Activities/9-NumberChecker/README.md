**Instructions:**
	* Using the displayed application as an example, create code in which:

	* A computer picks a random number between 1 and 4

	* Users then “click” buttons numbered 1 – 4.

	* If the user’s number matches the computer’s number, display text informing them that they won in the Result panel. Otherwise, display text informing them that they lost.

	* If you finish early, try to improve the aesthetics.
