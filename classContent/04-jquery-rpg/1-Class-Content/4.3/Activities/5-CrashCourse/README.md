**Phase I Objectives**

	* For this first 20 minutes, your goals should be to:

		* Become familiar with the various elements of the HTML page as it is written now. (Identify the classes and IDs that matter!)

		* Create a general strategy for how you will accomplish the task:
			* How will you capture button clicks?
			* What will you do with the numbers clicked?
			* What will you do when the operator is clicked?
			* How will you differentiate numbers from operators?
			* How will you know the "value" of a number clicked?
			* How will you know when a user is done entering the first number?
			* Etc.

		* Create a few test "on-click" events. These could just trigger Alert messages for now. If you get further along, then have these buttons alert their "value".

**Phase II Objectives**

	* For the next 30 minutes, your goals should be to:

		* Begin creating sets of variables that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:

			* firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result

		* Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML.

		* Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know they are done typing the first number).

		* Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user hits the "minus" button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: If-Then statements!)
